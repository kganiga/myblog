In this tutorial I am going to explain, how to set up GMAIL as your SMTP server in AEM to let you send emails out of your local author/publisher instance.

Set up a GMail account (or use your own if you feel comfortable where you are storing the information).

### Steps:

1. Go to the Felix Console Config Manager(http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr)
2. Scroll down and click to edit the Day CQ Mail Service OSGi config.
3. Enter the following details

| SMTP Server Host | smtp.gmail.com                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| SMTP Server Port | 465                                    |
| SMTP User        | your username (i.e. example@gmail.com) |
| SMTP Password    | your Password                          |
| From Address     | from address                           |
| SMTP Use SSL     | true (i.e. example@gmail.com)          |

4. Hit Save

5. Run a user through a workflow containing a group of which you are a member, or send out a newsletter to a group which you are a part of.

You should receive the email in your inbox.

It is worth noting that for production environments, you should set up a production grade SMTP service rather than use GMail.
