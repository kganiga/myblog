How to run JavaScript/jQuery code in my Blogger article was a question I had on my mind for a very long time. After doing some investigation, I discovered how to run the script inside a Blogger post.

Blogger post editor allows to add inline HTML code for markup, we are going to use this feature to achieve our goal.

- Create a blogger post, by clicking New Post on Blogger dashboard.
- Give your post title.
- On WYSIWYG editor, click on the Pencil button and select the HTML view.
- Insert your JavaScript/jQuery code inside script tag. \
   E.g : <script> PLACE YOUR JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY CODE HERE. </script>

### Sample Script :

```JavaScript
function moveRight(){
        $("#b").animate({left: "+=300"}, 2000,moveLeft)
    }

function moveLeft(){
        $("#b").animate({left: "-=300"}, 2000,moveRight)
    }

$(document).ready(function() {

       moveRight();

});
```
